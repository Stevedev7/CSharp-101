Welcome to my personal GitHub repository for C# 101! This repository documents my journey as I delve into the depths of C# and .NET, aiming to transition from a beginner to a proficient developer.

## Learning Objectives

Throughout this journey, I aim to:
1. Gain familiarity with basic programming concepts in C# such as loops, methods, arrays, and delegates.
2. Understand object-oriented programming concepts including classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
3. Acquire knowledge of various data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees, and learn how to implement them.

## Journey Outline

### Phase 1: C# Basics
- Introduction to C# and .NET framework
- Variables and Data Types
- Operators and Operator Precedence

### Phase 2: Control Structures
- Conditional Statements
- Loops (for, while, do-while)
- Jump Statements

### Phase 3: Data Handling
- Arrays and Types of Arrays
- Manipulating Arrays
- Strings and String Methods
- Manipulating Strings

### Phase 4: Object-Oriented Programming
- Introduction to Object-Oriented Concepts
- Classes and Objects
- Encapsulation and Abstraction
- Constructors

### Phase 5: Advanced OOP Features
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstract Classes and Interfaces

### Phase 6: C# Specific Features
- Static Class and Static Methods
- Extension Methods
- Partial Class and Partial Methods
- Properties and Indexers
- Enums

### Phase 7: Exception Handling and Delegates
- Understanding Exception Handling
- Implementing Delegates and Events
- Anonymous Methods and Lambda Expressions

### Phase 8: Advanced C# Concepts
- Expression Trees
- Understanding Synchronous and Asynchronous Programming

## Repository Structure

- **Phase Folders**: Each phase's learning is documented in its own folder, which includes:
  - Notes in Markdown format detailing the concepts learned.
  - Code samples and exercises in C# files.
  - Mini-projects to apply the concepts learned.

## How to Use This Repository

To follow my learning journey:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Start from Phase 1 and progress through the phases in order.
3. Read the notes, complete the exercises, and attempt the mini-projects.

## Stay Updated

Join me on this exciting journey to master C# and .NET, enhancing my programming skills and advancing my career!

### Git Repository Reset

After reverting the local repository to its initial state with 0 commits, you may encounter issues when trying to push the changes to the remote repository. This is because the remote repository is ahead of your local repository due to the previous commits.

To resolve this issue, you can use the following steps:

1. Pull the latest changes from the remote repository using `git pull origin master`.
2. Revert the local changes using `git reset --hard HEAD`.
3. Force push the changes to the remote repository using `git push origin master -f`.

This will reset the remote repository to match your local repository's state, effectively removing the previous commits. Note that this approach will rewrite the commit history, so use it with caution and ensure you have the necessary permissions.

Remember to exercise caution when rewriting commit history, especially in a collaborative environment, as it can cause issues for other contributors.
